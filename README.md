## üìù Key Assumptions

A crucial part of this analysis is the calculation of **Incremental ROAS**. The following assumption was made to estimate the true impact of the influencer campaigns:

-   **Baseline Organic Sales:** It is assumed that **15%** of the revenue attributed to an influencer would have been generated organically through other channels regardless of the campaign. Therefore, Incremental Revenue is calculated as `Attributed Revenue * (1 - 0.15)`.
